# Why
I always wanted to try out a flying sim. Tried my hands on vatious driving simulators, next is flying sims.
Got my first joystick logotech extreme 3d pro. Highly doubt its proness but seems to be a good starting point.

Have good experience of flying in gta and battlefield.

After watching movies like sully and flight it always amazed me what are all the switches in the control panel are for

Any movie based on flying dowsnt do justice in explaining them. So I took things in my own hands to learn.

first i installed DCS and took the most basic tugorial they have. Its somewhat good as a free resource but lacks anything in terms of training the digital instruments

i know flying a a320 is not a simple task and no simulator can give u the hands on experience but at least now i know what ILS is and how it works.

There are some other flying games but they dont have any good training sessions and interface is somewhat difficult.

Sturmovik IL2. no training and straight fkrward combat

ace combat - too much arcady

then there are few which tick the mark for simulators with good graphics

x plane 11
aero fs
dcs - expensive planes
msfs

after reading anf watching videos it turns out peoples choice is msfs.

first i purchase msfs X on steam. tried it out but being a really old generation game the graphics were not what i had in my mind.

msfs 2020 brings in the best combination of graphics and simulation, ofcourse comes at a price 4k in india.
