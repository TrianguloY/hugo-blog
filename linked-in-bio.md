# About
I have been working as a software developer since the [end of the world](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/). 

Have experience in the all stages of software development lifecycle including requirements, design, implementation and after sales support.

Having worked on various technologies, I have the right mix of understanding an enterprise level product.

Since the world wants to designate titles to quantify the skills, I would put myself as Senior Frontend Developer.

# Tech traits
* If required, I don't hesistate to learn a new framework or even a new language.
* I have experience in new generation products as well as legacy products
* Have worked in various domains like banking, supply chain, retail, ad-tech and cyber security
* Apart from the whole front-end world, in the past I have worked on mainframes, jsp, db2, j2ee, websphere etc
* I don't have a personal favorite framework. I believe every framework has its use case

# Non Tech traits
* I can work as an individual contributor or as a team member
* People find me quite friendly and an open person
* I respect other's time. Try my best to join meetings on time
* Mistakes are just a part of development
* I respect skill irrespective of the experience
* I do not discriminate people on any basis
* Personal health comes first. Everything comes next
* I like people who evaluate your work depending on the quality of code and not the time taken to write it
* As with everybody else, I have some opinions but I try not to force them on others

## What I worked on

* **COBOL** - It stands for Common Business Oriented Language. Well, if not common, but its certainly a special language. It appeared in 1959 when there was need of a language to process data for commercial purposes(thats why business oriented). Its special now because even today its [widely used](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cobol-turns-60-why-it-will-outlive-us-all/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20COBOL%20consulting,code%20keeping%20the%20lights%20on.).

* **Mainframes** - Mainframes were big systems used for bulk data processing since long ago. In other words, when portable computers were not powerful, large programs were run on big computers called Mainframes. Think of them as big data of that times. 

* **Batching** - While you can build almost everyday apps on any synchronous system, processing millions of transactions cannot be done live. When you scale, you need to start batching or as some people call it scheduling. Its not just for processing data, even [UI needs it now](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous).

* **JCL** - When you are scheduling thousands of jobs, you need a tool to manage those. JCL is a simple language which allows you to do that. It allows you to configure jobs and set things like what program to run, when to run and from where to pick the data.

* **Core Banking** - Banking systems are huge. They are generally divided into sub-systems like `Cards`, `Payments`, `Internet Banking`, `Core` etc. Customer Domain involves managing the customer's personal data like name, address, contacts, account info etc.

* **Java** - Mainframes were all fine when the bank operators used dummy terminals to connect them and log in to the system directly. Then there were desktop application which connected to mainframe via network. But with advancement in web application development, it became easier to work on any system via a browser. Thus we needed a web application that connects to the mainframe backend. This system was built using J2EE which connected to mainframes using IBM connectors.

* **Internet Banking** - Its same as other java based systems. A web application open for public which enables them to connect to backend systems. Of course, its not like every request goes to the mainframe. There are various optimizations done on each layer.

* **Customer Interaction** - When you are dealing with the customer directly, you need
