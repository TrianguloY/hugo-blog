# Brief Summary
I have been working as a software developer since the [end of the world](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/). 

Have experience in the all stages of software development lifecycle including requirements, design, implementation and after sales support.

Having worked on various technologies, I have the right mix of understanding an enterprise level product.

Since the world wants to designate titles to quantify the skills, I would put myself as Senior Frontend Developer.

# Tech traits
* If required, I don't hesistate to learn a new framework or even a new language.
* I have experience in new generation products as well as legacy products
* Have worked in various domains like banking, supply chain, retail, ad-tech and cyber security
* Apart from the whole front-end world, in the past I have worked on mainframes, jsp, db2, j2ee, websphere etc
* I don't have a personal favorite framework. I believe evey framework has its use case

# Non Tech traits
* I can work as an individual contributor or as a team member
* People find me quite friendly and an open person
* I respect other's time. Try my best to join meetings on time
* Mistakes are just a part of development
* I respect skill irrespective of the experience
* I do not discriminate people on any basis
* Personal health comes first. Everything comes next
* I like people who evaluate your work depending on the quality of code and not the time taken to write it
* As with everybody else, I have some opinions but I try not to force them on others
