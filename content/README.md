# Readme
I have started my [blog](https://cybercafe.dev) in 2019. Initially I was using wordpress then soon switched to [Ghostjs](https://ghostjs.org). Now I'm using Hugo to generate my pages out of markdown. I used to write in the ghost editor directly but after I got familiar with markdown, I guess I have never looked back. Markdown has all the options required for an article. The best part being the code highlighting. Coming from html and javascript world, it feels a little strange at first. 

This repository contains all my articles in markdown format.
