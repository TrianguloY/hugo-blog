If you are an experienced web developer, probably you already know  what is the difference or similarity between `JS` and `ES`. But for a vast  majority of upcoming devs this is still confusing.

I have asked this question to several candidates while interviewing for junior and senior web developers. And surprisingly half of the time the answer was **ES is the new version while JS is the older version of  the language**.

I can understand that this is because of the prominent amount of changes that ES6 brought with it there by popularizing the **ES** in ES6.

## Answer
Javascript is one of the  implementation of the `specification` termed as **Ecmascript**. There is a long history behind all these different names. I will try to summarize that.

> ECMAScript (or ES) is a [scripting-language-specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting-language) standardized by [Ecma International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. It was created to standardize [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

So basically you have always been developing in `ES` since `1996`. Its  just that we have been calling it `Javascript` as that was the name given to the language. Since Javascript is a registered trademark of **Sun microsystems**, while drafting the standard, the committee had to use a  different name. Without going creative, the organization ECMA drafted the specification as `ECMAScript`. But the language was still recognized as Javascript in the real world.

PS â€“ 10th edition of the specification was published in June 2019 and is commonly known as ES10.
