# blog
I have started my [blog](https://cybercafe.dev) few months back. Initially I was using wordpress but then soon switched to [Ghostjs](https://ghostjs.org). I used to write in the ghost editor directly but after I got familiar with markdown, I guess I have never looked back. Markdown has all the options required for an article. The best part being the code highlighting. Coming from html and javascript world, it feels a little strqnge at first. 

Though I am creating all new posts with markdown, but I have some older articles which I will be converting into markdown. All those articles are present in this repo. So even if I chose to switch my blogging platform, I will be able to migrate easily. And of course, this counts as a backup too:-D
